Where possible, we may provide you with notices or alerts on forks. However, it is your responsibility to make yourself aware of and consider how to deal with upcoming forks. In the event of a fork, there is a risk that we may need to temporarily suspend operations in relation to that fork without providing advance notice to you.

You acknowledge the risks presented by forks, and you accept that we have no responsibility to assist you in moving or selling an unsupported branch of a forked protocol.

offer to resolve your complaint in the way you requested;
make a determination to reject your complaint and set out the reasons for the rejection, or
