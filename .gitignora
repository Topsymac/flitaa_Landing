i. Force Majeure- We shall not be liable for delays, failure in performance or interruption of service which result directly or indirectly from any cause or condition beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to, any delay or failure due to any act of God, pandemic, epidemic, act of civil or military authorities, Governmental regulation or restriction, act of terrorists, civil disturbance, war, strike or other labor dispute, fire, interruption in telecommunications or Internet services or network provider services, failure of equipment and/or software, other catastrophe or any other occurrence which is beyond our reasonable control and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
ii. Historical Price Data- Flitaa makes no representations about the accuracy or completeness of historical Digital Asset price data available on the Platform. Flitaa will make reasonable efforts to ensure that requests for electronic debits and credits involving bank accounts and debit cards are processed in a timely manner, but Flitaa makes no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing, which is dependent upon many factors outside of our control.
iii. Entire Agreement- These Terms, the Privacy Policy and other Appendices incorporated by reference herein comprise the entire understanding and agreement between you and Flitaa as to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of any kind (including without limitation any prior versions of these Terms) and of every nature between and among you and Flitaa. Section headings in these Terms are for convenience only and shall not govern the meaning or interpretation of any provision of these Terms.
iv. Change of Control- In the event that Flitaa is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from you as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.
v. Survival- All provisions of these Terms that, by their nature, extend beyond the expiration or termination of these Terms, including, without limitation, sections pertaining to suspension or termination, Flitaa Account cancellation, debts owed to Flitaa, general use of the Flitaa App, disputes with Flitaa, and general provisions, shall survive the termination or expiration of these Terms.
vi. Fraud Management and Law enforcement- In the case of a suspected fraud involving either of, but not limited to, the following:
You send out funds to a Merchant for your Flitaa account to be credited and revisit your bank to report transaction as suspicious; or
You transfer funds into a Merchant's account, and law enforcement has reached out to you or us, reporting funds as illicit, to press for a refund; or
You gain access to another Flitaa user's wallet account and send out crypto or fiat currency and this is reported as unauthorised; or
A lien is placed on the merchant's account as law enforcement has reached out to the merchant or us, reporting funds received from you as illicit, to press for a refund.
Considering that the Platform is an online marketplace for independent traders or contractors, you agree that Flitaa shall not and cannot be liable to make refunds for Transactions that have been successfully processed.
Upon completion of the investigation, Flitaa reserves the right to recover fiat or Digital Currency from illicit or fraudulent internal transactions in favour of the complainant, provided that the fiat or Digital Currency received has not been sent out of the Flitaa platform.
You are advised to reach out to their financial institutions for further details on the transaction and also seek legal counsel and representation in order to protect your legal rights and avoid being treated as a suspect or criminal. On Flitaa's part, we will cooperate with legal authorities and courts of competent jurisdiction in order to support the legal due process and ensure that Flitaa is safeguarded from bad actors.
